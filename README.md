# node-template-repo
This is a template repository for myself with the sole purpose of creating future repositories that use webpack and npm easier.

-- Includes a .gitignore to ignore the node_modules and the dist file since the dist folder is going to be our bundled website code and node_modules is tracked by package.json and can be reinstalled based on package.json dependencies.

-- Updated 4/26/2025 with all of the basic html and css loaders for the webpack.config.js files. Also added the production mode and the development modes with npm scripts to run their respective config files.
